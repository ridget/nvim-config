# Nvim config

This is mostly stolen wholesale from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) but split out and separated into individual plugin files where appropriate.

Some minor customisation has been made for some small QoL features and this will probably expand over time with use-case specific bindings/plugins etc.
